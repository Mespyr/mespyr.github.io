				<h2>About Me</h2>
				Hello, my name is Senuk and I am currently in 8th grade. I taught myself to program when I was 10, and I've been programming ever since as a hobby.
				I really enjoy playing the baritone saxophone, and I love playing both jazz and classical pieces.

				<h2>Programming Journey</h2>

				<h4>2018-2019</h4>
				I started programming when I was 10 because I was taking an 'Introduction to Web Development' Harvard edX course, where I learned to program in HTML, CSS, and Python.
				I quit the course around halfway through because I was getting bored and I took really long on the first challenge, so I didn't have much time to do the others lol.
				</br></br>
				After that, I had started watching other programming tutorials for a bit to try to learn how to make other cool apps, which is how I found out about the TKinter gui framework.
				I used that to make a lot of projects that I was looking at. Coding with TKinter helped me a lot with understanding how object-oriented programming worked in general and helped me
				get passed the barrier of only being able to code from tutorials.

				<h4>2020</h4>
				I started to become more interested in the low level programming after I read a lot about Python being extremely slow, especially for the types of projects I wanted to make at the time.
				I wanted to code in a compiled programming language so my code would be faster and more cool looking to people who saw it. 
				</br></br>
				I turned to C++ to be my new, hopefully main, programming language and I struggled with it. A lot.
				But soon I got comfortable coding in C++, just like Python, and I started working on my own projects.
				At this point I kind of wish I had learned a different low level language like Rust, but I'm pretty sure Rust was either non-existent around this time, or not well known enough for me to have heard of it.

				<h4>2021-2022</h4>
				After a while, I became interested in how programming languages worked, after watching someone make their own in a video, and watching videos on esoteric languages.
				I started working on making my own by trying to find some tutorials on how they worked. I also found some really good tutorials and devlogs online.
				</br></br>
				During this time, I also became interested in game development. I tried learning OpenGL for a bit, quit because I didn't understand it at all, and tried learning Unity
				because I thought that since everyone was using it to make their games, it must be really good. I tried Unity, and got really annoyed with how slow it was on my laptop, so I decided to go back with OpenGL and try to actually properly follow a guide.
				Atleast that is what I would do if I didn't have school work to do.
