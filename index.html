				<h2>About Me</h2>
				Hello, my name is Senuk and I am currently in 8th grade. I taught myself to program when I was 10, and I've been programming ever since as a hobby.
				I really enjoy playing the baritone saxophone, and I love playing both jazz and classical pieces.

				<h2>Programming</h2>
				I started programming when I was 10 because I was taking an 'Introduction to Web Development' Harvard edX course, where I learned to program in HTML, CSS, and python.
				I quit the course around halfway through because I was getting bored and I took really long on the first challenge, so I didn't have much time to do the others lol.
				</br></br>
				After that, I had started watching other programming tutorials for a bit to try to learn how to make other cool apps, which is how I found out about the TKinter gui framework.
				I used that to make a lot of projects that I was looking at. Coding with TKinter helped me a lot with understanding how object-oriented programming worked in general and helped me 
				get passed the barrier of only being able to code from tutorials.
				</br></br>
				After a while of programming, I started to become more interested in the low level programming. I read a lot about python being extremely slow, and I wanted to code in a compiled language
				so my code would be faster, and more cool looking to people who saw it. I started by learning c++ using tutorials online, and I struggled. A LOT.
