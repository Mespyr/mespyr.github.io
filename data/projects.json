		"link": "https://github.com/Mespyr/lcp",
		"desc": "LCP is a stack-based programming language written in C++ that is fairly unique. It has control flow similar to Lipsem, where you can define labels and jump to them, but it also has a type-checking system built on top of it. LCP has no if/else statements or while loops, which means you have to use labels for all control flow. Unlike lipsem, LCP supports all arithmetic operations as well as all conditionals."

It has most of the features of any good programming language, like arithmetic operators and all comparison operators. It also supports if/else and while loops, as well as variables through the let bindings. You can also create const values and memory blocks to store data. Ach also has a small standard library for Linux, and has a type-checker."

		"link": "https://github.com/Mespyr/lipsem",
		"desc": "Lipsem was the first ever programming language I created. It is an esoteric, stack-based, interpreter written in C++, which only has a few essential features to code properly. It supports addition, subtraction, and jumping around through the definition of labels as well as being able to skip instructions, which leads to some intresting control flow."
